UTI involves a simple infection caused by urinary tract inflammation as well as a complicated infection that may be caused by an inflammation of other urinary tract organs. Since all of these infections have similar symptoms, it is difficult to identify the cause of primary infection. Therefore, it is not easy to diagnose a UTI with routine examination procedures. Invasive methods that require surgery could be necessary. This study aims to develop an artificial intelligence model to support the diagnosis of UTI with complex symptoms. Methods Firstly, routine examination data and definitive diagnosis results for 59 UTI patients gathered and composed as a UTI dataset. Three classification models namely; decision tree (DT), support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF) and artificial neural network (ANN), which are widely used in medical diagnosis systems, were created to model the definitive diagnosis results using the composed UTI dataset. Accuracy, specificity and sensitivity statistical measurements were used to determine the performance of created models. Results DT, SVM, RF and ANN models have 93.22%, 96.61%, 96.61%, 98.30% accuracy, 95.55%, 97.77%, 95.55%, 97.77% sensitivity and 85.71%, 92.85%, 100%, 100% specificy results, respectively. Conclusions ANN has the highest accuracy result of 98.3% for UTI diagnosis within the proposed models. Although several symptoms, laboratory findings, and ultrasound results are needed for clinical UTI diagnosis, this ANN model only needs pollacuria, suprapubic pain symptoms and erythrocyte to get the same diagnosis with such accuracy. This proposed model is a successful medical decision support system for UTI with complex symptoms. Usage of this artificial intelligence method has its advantages of lower diagnosis cost, lower diagnosis time and there is no need for invasive methods.","tags":["artificial intelligence"],"title":"FPGA-based self-organizing fuzzy controller for electromagnetic filter","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ilker Ali OZKAN","Saadetdin HERDEM","Ismail SARITAS"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1504213200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1504213200,"objectID":"fbc1b518a5c8cb4d9296befaa2398175","permalink":"http://www.ilkeraliozkan.com.tr/en/publication/fpga-control/","publishdate":"2017-09-01T00:00:00+03:00","relpermalink":"/en/publication/fpga-control/","section":"publication","summary":"Electromagnetic filters (EMF) are used to clean magnetic particles in industrial liquids which play important roles to sustain the high-quality material production in industrial fields. In this study, an FPGA-based adaptive fuzzy controller is realized to sustain high performance of an EMF. An experiment is performed by using realized adaptive controller on an EMF set. The results obtained from the experiment are compared with the results of the conventional fuzzy controller. It is observed that adaptive fuzzy controller is performed better than the conventional fuzzy controller.","tags":["FPGA","Control","Fuzzy"],"title":"FPGA-based self-organizing fuzzy controller for electromagnetic filter","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array - Alanda Programlanabilir Kapı Dizileri), programlanabilir mantık blokları ve bu bloklar arasındaki ara bağlantılardan oluşan ve geniş uygulama alanlarına sahip olan sayısal tümleşik devrelerdir.
