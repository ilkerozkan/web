UTI involves a simple infection caused by urinary tract inflammation as well as a complicated infection that may be caused by an inflammation of other urinary tract organs. Since all of these infections have similar symptoms, it is difficult to identify the cause of primary infection. Therefore, it is not easy to diagnose a UTI with routine examination procedures. Invasive methods that require surgery could be necessary. This study aims to develop an artificial intelligence model to support the diagnosis of UTI with complex symptoms. Methods Firstly, routine examination data and definitive diagnosis results for 59 UTI patients gathered and composed as a UTI dataset. Three classification models namely; decision tree (DT), support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF) and artificial neural network (ANN), which are widely used in medical diagnosis systems, were created to model the definitive diagnosis results using the composed UTI dataset. Accuracy, specificity and sensitivity statistical measurements were used to determine the performance of created models. Results DT, SVM, RF and ANN models have 93.22%, 96.61%, 96.61%, 98.30% accuracy, 95.55%, 97.77%, 95.55%, 97.77% sensitivity and 85.71%, 92.85%, 100%, 100% specificy results, respectively. Conclusions ANN has the highest accuracy result of 98.3% for UTI diagnosis within the proposed models. Although several symptoms, laboratory findings, and ultrasound results are needed for clinical UTI diagnosis, this ANN model only needs pollacuria, suprapubic pain symptoms and erythrocyte to get the same diagnosis with such accuracy. This proposed model is a successful medical decision support system for UTI with complex symptoms. Usage of this artificial intelligence method has its advantages of lower diagnosis cost, lower diagnosis time and there is no need for invasive methods.","tags":["artificial intelligence"],"title":"Diagnosis of urinary tract infection based on artificial intelligence methods","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" In this tutorial, I\u0026rsquo;ll share my top 10 tips for getting started with Academic:\nTip 1 \u0026hellip;\nTip 2 \u0026hellip;\n","date":1536440400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"tr","lastmod":1536440400,"objectID":"6a451186c775f5f0adb3a0416d0cb711","permalink":"http://www.ilkeraliozkan.com.tr/tutorial/example/","publishdate":"2018-09-09T00:00:00+03:00","relpermalink":"/tutorial/example/","section":"tutorial","summary":"In this tutorial, I\u0026rsquo;ll share my top 10 tips for getting started with Academic:\nTip 1 \u0026hellip;\nTip 2 \u0026hellip;","tags":null,"title":"Example Page","type":"docs"},{"authors":["Ilker Ali OZKAN","Saadetdin HERDEM","Ismail SARITAS"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1504213200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"tr","lastmod":1504213200,"objectID":"d714971c92581bcdf59a61a1743276f5","permalink":"http://www.ilkeraliozkan.com.tr/publication/fpga-control/","publishdate":"2017-09-01T00:00:00+03:00","relpermalink":"/publication/fpga-control/","section":"publication","summary":"Electromagnetic filters (EMF) are used to clean magnetic particles in industrial liquids which play important roles to sustain the high-quality material production in industrial fields. In this study, an FPGA-based adaptive fuzzy controller is realized to sustain high performance of an EMF. An experiment is performed by using realized adaptive controller on an EMF set. The results obtained from the experiment are compared with the results of the conventional fuzzy controller.

Though this system does not diagnose cancer conclusively, it helps the doctor in deciding whether a biopsy is necessary by providing information about whether the patient has prostate cancer or not. Data from 121 patients who were definitively diagnosed with cancer after biopsy were used in devising the system. The results of the definitive diagnoses of the patients and the results of the ANN that was performed were analysed using confusion matrix and ROC analyses. As a result of ANN, which was implemented on the basis of these analyses, success rates of 94.11% and 94.44% were achieved for prognosis of disease and validity, respectively. The ANN, which yielded these high rates of reliability, will help doctors make quick and reliable diagnoses without any risks and make it a better option to monitor patients with low prostate cancer risk on whom biopsies must not be carried out through a policy of wait and see.","tags":["Artificial neural network","Prognosis of prostate cancer"],"title":"Prognosis of prostate cancer by artificial neural networks","type":"publication"}]
